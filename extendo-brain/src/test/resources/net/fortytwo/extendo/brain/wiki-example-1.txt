    * basic syntax
        * TinkerNotes uses a slight variant of wiki list syntax
        * basically, you have nested notes with bullets, values, and attribute-value pairs
    * indentation
        * all white space before the bullet is indentation
        * it determines the degree of nesting
        * notes can be nested to any degree
            * like this...
                * and this...
                    * and this
        * a child must be indented more than its parent
          * and identically to its siblings
          * but it can be indented differently than its cousins
    * bullets
        * the asterisk is the default bullet, but
        - other single characters can also be bullets
        *  at least one space is required between bullet and value
        *        but more spaces are OK, too
    * attributes
        @alias http://example.org/ns/attributes
        @weight 0.75
        * three attributes are allowed: @alias, @weight, and @sharability
        * the @alias attribute defines an alternative URI for the topic of the note, while
        * @weight and @sharability expect numeric values
    * white space
        * tab characters are converted to four spaces each: "    "
        * all other whitespace characters count as single spaces: " "
        * newlines can be preserved with triple braces {{{
like this.
Use as many lines of text as you need.
}}}
        * 	 leading and trailing whitespace are ignored

        * blank lines don't matter

    * ids
        * :0txXBm: each note has a base-64 id, which is indicated with an infix after the bullet
        *    :cE85nD:    the id is optional, and it is treated as white space

        * :69qkF3: blank lines still don't matter
    * got it?
